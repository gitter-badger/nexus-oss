Nexus Ruby Support
==================

This repository contains components and Nexus plugins to enhance Nexus with Ruby support. Stay tuned!

Powered with JRuby.

Problems to solve:

 * Maven Version to Ruby Gems Version convert (hard)
 * Currently, we do Gems from Java. Maybe reuse Ruby Gems to do that?
 * Indexing should be enhanced. Ruby Gems indexer does publish proper indexes downstream, but no Nexus integration is added yet (Gems are not searchable).
 * Enhance the embedded Ruby class in Gems created out of Jar, resolve: conflicts, better naming, etc.

Have fun!
